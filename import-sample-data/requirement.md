# Requirement

{% hint style="info" %}
We are very happy to provide customers with a new function to import data more quickly. It is a "One-click import"
{% endhint %}

With "One click import", customers do not import step by step data as import usual. It imports all data like Content, Widget, Revolution slider, Menu, Customize...

### **To use the "One-click import" function, you need to meet the following requirements:**

* Active parent theme
* Uploads folder writable
* [For best performance, we recommend using PHP 7.2 or higher.](https://wordpress.org/support/upgrade-php/)
* MySQL 5.6 or greater OR MariaDB 10.0 or greater
* Nginx or Apache with mod\_rewrite module
* HTTPS support
* Memory Limit 512M or higher
