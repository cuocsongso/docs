# ðŸš€ Optimization

Maia is created with speed and performance in mind. On its own, Maia is highly optimized and provides you with the ability to get extremely high-speed test scores on tools like GTMetrix, Google PageSpeed Insights, and Web Page Speed Test. Having said this, your site's speed and performance do not entirely rely on the theme and what you put into it also has a great impact on your speed scores. Continue reading below to learn more about site optimization.

When it comes to optimization, Maia plays a much smaller part than you would imagine. Maia is optimized so that it's fast on its own, but ultimately, user content will dictate how fast your site will perform. Images play a huge factor in speed results, as well as hosting, server, extra plugins, content, and more.

For example, if you have a site that's 1100px wide and upload a 2000px image on a page, your page speed score will drop heavily. This is because places like Google or GTMetrix will see a 1100px container that unnecessarily has an image on it that is twice its size.
